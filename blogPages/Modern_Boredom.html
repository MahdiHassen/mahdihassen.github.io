<p>
  In modern society, the concept of boredom has undergone a significant transformation. The presence of social media, the internet, and various forms of entertainment has eradicated the possibility of experiencing true boredom. Instead, what has emerged is a pervasive state characterized by incessant urges—compulsions to check our phones, emails, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and any other digital platforms. These urges, driven by the immediate gratification of  a dopamine rush, occupy our attention, effectively replacing the traditional notion of boredom with a constant need for digital engagement. </p>


  <p>
    Even if a person isolates themselves in a room without an internet connection and deletes all social media, true boredom remains impossible to achieve. True boredom is the state of having exhausted all possible options. The mere knowledge that the internet exists, prevents a person from experiencing true boredom. This awareness keeps the potential for engagement and distraction ever-present, making it impossible to be completely bored. Thus, in our modern world, the very idea of the internet stops us from truly experiencing boredom. True boredom, therefore, is replaced by urges. Where true boredom should reside, these urges take its place.

  <p>
    This transformation from boredom to urges is inevitable. As long as the internet and its ease of access exist, humans will be barred from true boredom, and thus, barred from reality.
