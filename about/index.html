    i'm interested in a lot of things, but generally i love all things
    computers. things like computer architecture, soc design & embedded
    systems really peak my interest. outside of engineering i read a lot of

  <h4>
    this website
  </h4>
  <div class = "text">
  this website is pure html & css, no javascript or anything. i do this
    for a couple of reasons, but mainly due to compatibility, speed and
    simplicity.
  </div>

  <div class = "text">
    on here i mainly just share things i find interesting. this includes projects im working on,
    thoughts on what im reading/studying and just things that i wish to keep for reference.
    i'd like to eventually have a personal knowledge base, similar to something like
    <a href = "https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ"><u>Andy Matuschak's working notes.</u></a>
  </div>

  <div class = "text">
    its changed quite a bit since its inception, but i originally based the design of this
    website on something i saw at www.brutalistwebsites.com. unfortunately, i
    can't find the original inspiration anymore, but if you know the original
    website please shoot me an email so i can give them credit.
  </div>
  <h4>
    my blog
  </h4>
  <div class = "text">
    remind me to fill in this section when i've written some more, but i hope to
    get a blog out every 2 months or so
