  <h4>
    me
  </h4>
  <p> i'm currently a master's computer/electrical engineering student at the university of waterloo where i'm researching real time hardware/software systems. i earned my bachelors of engineering in June 2025.
  </p>

  <p>
    i'm interested in a lot of things, but generally i love all things computers. things like computer architecture, soc design & embedded systems really peak my interest. outside of engineering i read a lot of philosophy, which i try to talk about in my <a href="../blog"> <u>blog</u></a>. i also enjoy astronomy and building telescopes.
  </p>

  <h4>
    this website
  </h4>
  <p>
  this website is pure html & css. i do this for a couple of reasons, but mainly due to compatibility, speed and simplicity.i am also not a web developer, so it's probably fine.
  </p>

  <p>
    on here i mainly just share things i find interesting. this includes projects im working on, thoughts on what im reading/studying and just things that i wish to keep for reference. i sometimes share small webapps i make for my own use, but i remove them when i no longer have a use for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    its changed quite a bit since its inception, but i originally based the design of this website on something i saw at www.brutalistwebsites.com. unfortunately, i can't find the original inspiration anymore, but if you know the original website please shoot me an email so i can give them credit.
  </p>

  <h4>
    my blog
  </h4>
  <p>
    i mainly write about things i'm thinking about, or that i've read. i don't research too much before i write, so i may get some things wrong. if you disagree with something feel free to email me, and i'd be happy to chat. i also write about technical things, but i don't post about them too often since they get long and hard to format. anyway, i hope to get a blog out every 2 months or so.
