As a result you end up learning better, even if the brain power targeted towards the actual material is the same. <br><br>this is why writing about something is a good way to learn it. when you write, there's a lot of brain power being put into how to word things for someone else to understand. while the concept floats freely in your head, it takes little brain power to recall it. its only after we impose some constraint on it (like a language) that we use our brain enough to really learn it.

  "content": "i started these notes because I want to keep a personal knowledgebase of things. I was initially going to use my blog for this, but writing an entire blog post for something small and unorganized felt like a waste. </br> </br>This will mostly consist me trying to learn technical concepts by writing about them. For example I will probably write a note on Rent's rule, which is a concept I'm learning in my Network-on-Chip class. I also expect there be a fair share of notes which are only used to keep track of resources or stupid ideas that aren't worth a blog post. </br> </br> On here you can open up multiple notes side by side (desktop exclusive). The point of this page is simulate a cluttered desk. I think wiki's are good for sharing knowledge to the public, but its much easier to mentally keep track of things if you just see it all in front of you.</br> </br> Anyway, this kind of reads like a blog post at the point, so I'll stop it here." }
