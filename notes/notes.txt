             <p>This will mostly consist me trying to learn technical concepts by writing about them. For example my next note will probably be on Rent&#39;s rule, which is a concept I&#39;m learning in my Network-on-Chip class.</p>
             <p>I also expect there be a fair share of notes which are only used to keep track of resources or anything really.</p>
             <p>On here you can open up multiple notes side by side (desktop exclusive). The point of this page is simulate a cluttered desk. I think wiki&#39;s are good for sharing knowledge to the public, but its much easier to mentally keep track of things if you just see it all in front of you.</p>
             <p>Anyway, this kind of reads like a blog post at the point, so I&#39;ll stop it here.</p>." }
