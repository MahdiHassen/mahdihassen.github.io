I was initially going to use my blog for this, but writing an entire blog post for something small and unorganized felt like a waste. </br> </br>This will mostly consist me trying to learn technical concepts by writing about them. For example my next note will probably be on Rent's rule, which is a concept I'm learning in my Network-on-Chip class. I also expect there be a fair share of notes which are only used to keep track of resources or anything really. </br> </br> On here you can open up multiple notes side by side (desktop exclusive). The point of this page is simulate a cluttered desk. I think wiki's are good for sharing knowledge to the public, but its much easier to mentally keep track of things if you just see it all in front of you.</br> </br> Anyway, this kind of reads like a blog post at the point, so I'll stop it here." }
